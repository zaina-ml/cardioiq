# CardioIQ  
AI-Powered Cardiovascular Risk Analysis

## Overview

CardioIQ is an end-to-end fully functional AI-based system designated for accurate cardiovascular risk assessment outside a doctor’s office. The platform aims to help individuals recognize potential cardiovascular risks earlier and take meaningful action before symptoms take effect.

---

## Problem

Signs for cardiovascular disease can often be missed, especially outside clinical settings. Nationwide, about 15% of U.S. adults report never having received any cardiovascular screening. Many communities also lack reliable access to cardiovascular screening due to financial strain or limited healthcare resources.

Without interpretable risk information, individuals are less likely to address their health or seek medical guidance.

## Solution

CardioIQ provides an accessible, AI-powered solution to prevent cardiovascular disease through interpretable risk assessment. The platform utilizes a combination of ECG data, user-input health metrics, and advanced AI algorithms in order to produce a clinically relevant cardiovascular risk.
